# 🗳️ VoteKing
A simple and beginner-friendly voting DApp smart contract built with Solidity
📖 Project Description

VoteKing is a minimalistic Ethereum smart contract designed for beginners to understand the fundamentals of blockchain voting systems.
It allows users to cast one vote for one of two fixed candidates — Alice or Bob — and automatically determines the winner.

The project is intentionally kept simple, with no input fields, so new learners can easily deploy and interact with it using Remix IDE or other Ethereum development tools.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Lets anyone vote for one of two candidates: Alice or Bob.

- Prevents users from voting more than once using a mapping.

- Keeps a live tally of votes for each candidate.

- Displays the current winner or declares a tie.

## ✨ Features

✅ Beginner-friendly Solidity code (no complex logic)

🧠 Demonstrates key blockchain concepts like mappings, state variables, and require statements

🔒 Prevents double voting

🪙 Transparent voting count visible on-chain

🚀 Easily deployable on Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry
